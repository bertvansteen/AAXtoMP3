## AuthCode
This is a python3 compatible version of https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activator. 


It is one approach of getting your AuthCode. It uses selenium to automate Chrome.
Using this approach requires you to install selenium and chromedriver:

```
pip install selenium

brew cask install chromedriver
```

```brew install chromedriver``` seems not working anymore.
